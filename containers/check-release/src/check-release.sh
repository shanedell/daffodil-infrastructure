# Read a list of newline separated paths from a file ($1) and commands from
# stdin to evaluate for each line in the file. Each line in the file is
# expected to be a path to a file, but it is not enforced. All {} strings in the
# commands are replaced with the current line in the file prior to evaluation.
# The commands are also evaluated in a new bash process, so they are free to
# include commands like 'cd' or 'exit' without affecting the main script. Note
# this means they cannot access variables or functions in the current process
# scope. For each line, this outputs a pass/fail icon (based on the exit code
# of the last command) followed by the line. A count of all failures is tallied
# in the FAILURE_COUNT variable.
#
# Usage tips:
#
# It is recommended to wrap {} in apostrophes to avoid unexpected variable or
# other expansions.
#
# Process substitution can be used for the file list to to avoid the need to
# create actual files.
#
# Commands are read from stdin to support the recommended use of heredocs. In
# general, tests should use <<-'CMD' commands CMD, especially if no variable
# expansion or process substitution is wanted or needed. If that is needed,
# tests should usually use <<-CMD commands CMD.
#
# Usage examples:
#
# test_files all_text_files.txt <<-'CMD'
#     gpg --verify '{}.asc' '{}'
# CMD
#
# test_files <(find dir/ -name '*.txt') <<-CMD
#     cmp '{}' "$OTHER_DIR"/'{}'
